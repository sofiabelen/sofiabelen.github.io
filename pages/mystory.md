The thought of starting a blog has been in the back of my mind for a long time, now that I th
ink about it. For one thing, I enjoy writting and want to share part of my life. Though the m
ain goal of this blog will be to connect with likeminded people, to help each other in the se
arch and fulfillment of our passions. 

I am a computer science student in Russia, currently living in Nizhny Novgorod. How and why I
 ended up in Russia... is also something I would like to share. I'm from Argentina, by the wa
y, so it's probably one of the most distant places I could've choosen. Studying in a foreign 
country, learning a language from scratch and actually taking your classes in that language..
. is something I wouldn't have thought I'd be doing. But here I am, and I want to show you wh
at this is really like.
