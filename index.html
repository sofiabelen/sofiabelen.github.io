        <p>
I'm currently at a turning point in life. Only one year and a half away from graduating from MIPT, I had to leave Russia and everything I had been working on behind because of the war. It was not an easy decision to make, but I'm hoping to turn this situation into an opportunity for growth. Now I'm temporarily living in Spain, applying for jobs and internships across Europe. My aspiration is to work in Computation Fluid Dynamics (CFD).

        <p>
A little about me. I had the chance to study at MIPT with a scholarship. Without knowing any Russian, I took a year long language course before starting my studies here in Moscow. The first year was the toughest, I had barely any time for anything besides university. With some effort, I developed better time management skills and realized that I would burn out if I focused solely on my studies. So, I began prioritizing personal growth and projects I enjoyed, which made me a happier person overall.

During secondary school, I was lucky enough to be introduced to the world of programming competitions. I met extraordinary people, and it changed my view of the world. It helped me realize that those we see as our 'competitors' are actually really cool and interesting people. What a better place to meet new friends?

        <p>
In conclusion, I believe one crucial skill in life is the ability to plan in times of crisis and not be afraid of change. Not accepting fate as it comes but building it with your own hands.
