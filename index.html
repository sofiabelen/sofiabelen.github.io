        Only one year and a half away from graduating from the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology (MIPT), I made the difficult decision to leave Russia and my studies behind. 
        </p>
        <p>
        When asked why, the easy answer is because of the war... but in reality the idea had already been in my mind for some time already. I felt I had beat the major challenges in that stage of my life:
        </p>

        <i class="icon fa-check"></i> learn Russian
        </br>

        <i class="icon fa-check"></i> get into the MIPT physics and math program with scholarship
        </br>

        <i class="icon fa-check"></i> survive Russian education system 
        <a href="https://sofiabelen.github.io/blog/russian-education-maddness.html">(check out this post)</a>
        </br>

        <i class="icon fa-check"></i> get into dream department (comp physics) where everyone loves linux

        <i class="icon fa-check"></i> code cool fluid simulation

        <i class="icon fa-check"></i> become an official Physicist: pass and ace the State Qualification Exam in Physics
        </br>
        </br>

        <p>What I couldn't accomplish, though:</p>

        <i class="icon fa-skull-crossbones"></i> finish school with an intact nervous system
        </br>

        <i class="icon fa-skull-crossbones"></i> recover from ongoing burn-out
        </br>

        <i class="icon fa-skull-crossbones"></i> have time, energy and money to pursue non-school related passions
        </br>
        </br>

        <h3>Basically, I craved for the next step</h3>

        <p>
        Our (Santiago's and mine) plan was to finish studying and move to Europe to look for a job.
        However, why exactly did we have to things in that particular order?

        It felt as if we were stuck postponing life until we were in Europe.
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            When I have my own money and my own space and more time...
            I will start doing x, y and z.
        </blockquote>

        <p>
        So, that's why we decided to stop postponing and start living.
        </p>

        <p>
        The decision wasn't easy, it was a huge risk, and there were
        many challenges and fears we had to overcome.
        </p>

        <i class="fa-solid fa-bullseye"></i> 4 days of traveling and sleeping in airports to get out of Russia

        <i class="fa-solid fa-bullseye"></i> 2 long months of uncertainty, not knowing if we'd make it
        </br>
        </br>

        <p>
        After the most difficult ~2 months of my life, here we are finally,
        starting a new life in Germany.
