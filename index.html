                <p>For some it might be writting, solving a really hard math problem, or even
 engaging in a deep conversation. What all these have in common is what they trigger in each 
persons's brain. Flow is described as the state of mind where you are concentrated in the tas
k at hand and all your brainpower goes to performing that task. All things like surroundings 
and distracting thoughts seem to blur in the background, so you reach maximum concentration. 
This is why you loose track of time.</p>
