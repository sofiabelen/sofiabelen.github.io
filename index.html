            I'm from Argentina, studying in Moscow, and aspiring to specialize in Computational Fluid Dynamics. During secondary school, I was lucky enough to be introduced to the world of programming competitions. I met extraordinary people, and it changed my view of the world. It helped me realize that those we see as our 'competitors' are actually really cool and interesting people. What a better place to meet new friends?

            Then, came a bigger challenge. I was given the chance to study at MIPT with a scholarship. Without knowing any Russian, I took a year long language course before starting my studies here in Moscow. The first year was the toughest, I had barely any time for anything besides university, but now I more or less found a balance between studies, personal life, and working on side projects. My goal now is to learn as much as I can about CFD and aim for an internship!
