	<p>For some it might be writing, for others, solving maths problems, and for some, engaging in a deep conversation. What all these things have in common is what they trigger in our brains. Flow is described as the state of mind where you are fully engaged in what you're doing, loosing sense of time and surroundings. I'd argue it's the best state for the human brain to be in.</p>
        <p>This is a place where I share my experiences and thoughts on things like self-study, going to university in a forreign lanuguage, and choosing a career path. I also hope to connect with like minded people and learn from each other.</p>
