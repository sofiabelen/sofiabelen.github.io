        <p>Hello, my name is Sofia and I'm from Argentina. I've been into competitive programming since the age of 15, and now, I'm studying physics and mathematics at the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology. This is a blog from the point of view of a self-learner, where I wish to share my experiences, and, maybe, connect with others with similar goals and interests. I write about what it's like being a foreign student in a Russian university, and my journey in choosing a career path. I'd love for you to stick around!</p>
