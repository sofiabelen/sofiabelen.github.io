I'm currently at a turning point in life. Only one year and a half away from graduating from the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology (MIPT), I had to leave Russia because of the war. It was not an easy decision to make, but I'm hoping to turn this situation into an opportunity for growth. Currently, temporarily living in Spain, applying for jobs and internships.

A little about me. I had the opportunity to study at MIPT with a scholarship. Without knowing any Russian, I took a year long language course before starting my studies in Moscow. The first year was the toughest, I had barely any time for anything besides university. With some effort, I developed better time management skills and realized that I would burn out if I focused solely on my studies. So, I began prioritizing personal growth and projects I enjoyed, which made me a happier person overall.

During secondary school, I was lucky enough to be introduced to the world of programming competitions. I met extraordinary people, and it changed my view of the world. It helped me realize that those we see as our 'competitors' are actually really cool and interesting people. What a better place to meet new friends? During these years, I also experience something that I value greatly: the chance of working on something you are passionate about and striving for a goal that may seem unrealistic. The reason I mention this is because I believe that whatever it is you pursue, you should do it for its own sake and because there's nothing else you'd rather be doing, and not for an external reward. In this case, my goal was to classify for the International Olympiad in Informatics, this was the external reward, which to me seemed pretty much impossible at the time. However, that didn't matter because I loved competitive programming: solving problems, learning new algorithms, and taking part in the competitions. What mattered is that the process gave me fulfillment and happiness. In the end, I did end up classifying for the IOI and it marked the culmination of my competitive programming journey.

In conclusion, I believe one crucial skill in life is the ability to plan in times of crisis and not be afraid of change. Not accepting fate as it comes but building it with your own hands.
