title: My approach to learning a foreign language

I learned English through immersion, you could say, living in the US. Went to the Goethe Institute to learn German for 4 years, and I'm currently studying in a Russian university, in Russian.

The most important part of my foreign language routine is, without a doubt, spaced repetition.
