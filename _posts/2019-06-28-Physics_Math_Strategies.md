title: Bulletproof strategy for learning Physics and Math
categories: selfstudy
---
Studying a subject like math or physics requires a different strategy from, let's say, learning a foreign language. [You can read my post about that here](http://justanotherstudent.tk/selfstudy/2019/06/25/foreignlanguages.html). The essence of these subjects is, in my opinion, grasping the concepts and solving problems. The problem solving aspect is the main reason I enjoy it, since it forces you to actively participate in the learning process, rather than being a passive spectator.

That said, here are the steps I usually follow when tackling these subjects.

## 1. Read the theory

It's vital that you tackle this process as actively as you can. What I usually do, is to take notes at the same time I'm reading. If I don't understand something, I look it up from a different source right away, taking notes of what I find. You might hear this a lot, but writing the concepts down instead of passively reading is vital to make sure you really understand what you're reading. Plus it helps make things stick, without recurring to rote memorization.

Another important step is to solve the examples without looking at the solution. That way you make sure you actually understand everything, and it helps to become familiar with the type of problems you'll be solving next.

It's also very helpful to keep a graphing calculator like [desmos](https://www.desmos.com/calculator) open, so you can better visualize what you're doing:

## 2. Tackle the problems

This is perhaps the most important step because simply understanding the concepts isn't always enough. You have to come up with ways to manipulate what you learned in the previous step, this forces you to test the limits of what can be done. 

Don't get discouraged if you can't come up with a solution at first. This doesn't mean that you didn't understand the theory, it just means that you are learning how to manipulate it. Keep trying as many alternatives as you can, and even if you don't succeed, you're still making progress. You are testing what works and what doesn't in various scenarios.

If you tried everything and you still can't solve it, don't worry. Look up the solution, and read as little as possible and try to take it from there. Don't be discouraged if you couldn't solve it by yourself, next time you face a similar problem, you'll know how to tackle it. You'll discover a new perspective or point of view that you didn't see before, and this is where the beauty lies. 

As a side note: this might sound obvious, but you definitely need a problem set with solutions available. Having someone else grade your answer or having to ask a professor for help is an alternative, but you'd be wasting too much time. It's better to have everything at hand.

If you do manage to solve it, you're not done yet. Let's say you arrived at the correct answer, but with a different approach? Congrats! But don't assume it's a correct approach, try to prove it it's correct or look it up online. If all else fails, you can post it in a forum like stackoverflow, so others can check if it's okay. 

Sometimes, however, you'll arrive at a different solution with a different approach. This is very tricky, and sometimes you'll need someone else to take a look at your work. Maybe there's a small error, or the whole approach is wrong. Either way, don't move on until you understand what you did wrong.

If you discovered a new technique, it's helpful to write it down somewhere. See the next step about making a summary.

Also, I always keep an instance of python open next to my PDF reader to quickly make calculations:

## 3. Make summaries

In this step, I make write down the most important concepts, finding connections between them. Don't write down explanations, only key words and formulas. If you realize there is still something you didn't really understand, don't worry, it's part of the purpose of this step. Go back to step 1 until you're confident. This is also where you write down your new problem solving techniques. 

You should be proud when you reach this step, you can be confident you almost mastered a topic. However, don't stop here, as you keep moving forward in the material, keep remaking your summaries. Get rid of irrelevant stuff and add new discoveries. You can keep a separate notebook for this, and you'll see the progress you're making, they'll get more concise and to the point. This will serve as precious reference material as you move forward.

## 4. Reinforce with videos/lectures

I usually prefer studying from a textbook rather than watching videos, since I feel it's faster, but that's just a personal preference. However, we are social creatures. Concepts sometimes stick better if you watch someone else explain it or show a demonstration (especially in physics).

If you go to university, this step is the same as going to lectures. Make sure you always study the material beforehand, so you can ask relevant questions or simply follow along better.

## Bonus: my sources for self study

For physics, I love watching the lectures by [Walter Lewin](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiEHVhv0SBMpP75JbzJShqw). The passion with which he teaches is inspiring, and you cannot help but love his demonstrations.

For math, [3blue1brown](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw) is my favorite without a doubt. If you haven't watched his videos, I strongly recommend you watch them, whether you're a beginner or have a masters degree in math. His way of illustrating concepts is just too beautiful to miss.

As far as textbooks go, I'm studying physics from Irodov right now. It's a great source, very in depth, but you'll be doing a lot of googling if it's your first time studying a topic, since it tends to assume that you already know a lot of things. However, it's also fun to try to play with the equations yourself to see if you can arrive at whatever conclusion he's making. The problem set: [Problems in General Physics](https://www.amazon.com/Problems-general-physics-I-Irodov/dp/5030008004) is great place to apply the strategies listed above, since the problems usually require that you twist and manipulate what you learned in unexpected ways. In the end, you end up with new perspectives and a lot of "aha!" moments. Some people say it's not suited for beginners, but if you keep google at your side, I think it's one of the best ways to get started with physics.

If you reached this part, thank you for reading! I hope this was helpful, and I'd love to hear what your personal techniques are. Leave a comment bellow, share so others can also benefit.
