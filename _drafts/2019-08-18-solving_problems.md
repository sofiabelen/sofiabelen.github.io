title: When to give up and look up a solution
categories: blog
---
Less than 2 weeks before starting university, and I'm excited but also very nervious. There are still some things to sort out: getting a new phone plan, travelling to Nizhny to bring some stuff to Moscow, getting settled down in the student dorms. We'll meet our new roommates, secretly hoping they'll be introverts like us.

Speaking of being nervious, there is this one thought that scares me more than anything. Sitting down facing a problem sheet, reading them, and not having a clue how to approach them. This scares me because I don't usually have much patience when this happens. It'ssomething that has hold me back in past. When solving a problem, be it related to programming or something else, if I'm not able to come up with solution, or at least things to try out to try and solve it, I give up way too early. I get desperate, start thinking that I won't have enough time to solve all the problems if I spend too much on just one... but, after reading the solution, I regret it, wondering weather I could've come up with it myself, had I given myself the chance. Maybe I wouldn't have, but in trying stuff out, it's a good way to get a better grasp of the material.

The reason I decided to write this post is because I want to make a commitment to change this non-constructive behaviour. From now on, every time I'm facing a problem, no matter how out-of-reach it might look, I won't look up the solution. This has to be the last resort.

I really don't know if this is something common or if it's just a byproduct of my sometimes low selfsteem. Now that I think about it, it probably has something to do with fear of failure. I'm sure it happens to everybody, in different ways, of course. The fear that keeps you from taking a risk, or letting go of an opportunity for fear of not measuring up. This way of thinking holds us back, I know it has affected me many times.

I'm not a psycologist, but this pattern of thought can't be healthy. However, I'm not completely sure how to tackle this issue. A good first step is knowing that something has to change, and then working towards improvement.
