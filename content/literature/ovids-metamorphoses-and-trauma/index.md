I'm not even halfway through and I feel I have so much to say about this work,
and what it says about us, as a species and as a society. I can see why it is
that works like this keep getting read generation after generation: it holds
a mirror to ourselves. It show us our reality through a slightly different
lens, forcing us to notice what we would've otherwise not paid attention to.

Topics I'm intersting in discussing:
- Trauma and Transformation
- Juno as the ultimate 'not a girls girl' archetype
- Human Condition: Fate, Sin and Free Will
- Human Condition: How it becomes more clear once we compare it gods
    - gods have will, humans subject to fate. although not even gods are immune to fate
