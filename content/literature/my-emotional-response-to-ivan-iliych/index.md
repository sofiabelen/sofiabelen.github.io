I've been lately on a search for something, though I'm not quite sure what. First, i tried looking inside, through mindfulness and Buddhist practices. That seemed like the way, until it didn't. I wasn't willing to commit and sacrifice so much for something that seemed elusive. I am also not quite sure I agree with the core premise, at least it didn't align for what I want for my own life. I am not necessarily looking to avoid suffering. Though many techniques and principles did stick and I'm glad I ventured. Then, I also looked into psychology, books like "The body keeps the score" and "Complex PTSD: From surviving to thriving." I hyperfixated on that for a while, and I believe I gained valuable knowledge. Now, however, I've adverted my gace in a different direction. I'm now looking into literature to try to find that which I cannot name. 

Disclaimer: I'm not going to try and make a literary analysis of this work. That has been done by experts who are much more capable. I just want to share the effect this work had on me, as a reader.

# Why Does It Matter If We're Ready For Death

Ultimately, though, even if we have loved ones by our side, we must face death alone. Must we be "ready for when it comes"? Does it really matter? One could say, it's only some moments of extreme suffering and then it's all over, why does it matter or why Should we worry so much about how death will find us?

I think it has to do not with avoiding suffering in those last moments, but more so in what those last moments reveal for us. What it grants us is perspective. The big picture. It brings up our most raw emotions and truest desires. I would guess. At least the thought experiment does seem to bring something valuable to the surface.
